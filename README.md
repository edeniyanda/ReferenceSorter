# ReferenceSorter

🧙‍♂️ Conquer the chaos! My mom's project references were overwhelming. She said, "Hey, come sort these references for me alphabetically by the first author's name." But I couldn't bear the mess, so I created ReferenceSorter—a Python Class. It sorts references, transforming the chaos into order on her magical academic quest! 😄✨

**Problem solved!** 🪄🎩
